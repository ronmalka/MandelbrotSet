This assignment has been made as a part of the Computer Graphics course that I took in my bachelor's degree in computer science at Ben-Gurion University.

In this assignment, we implemented a Mandelbrot set with OpenGL and C++. We dealt with calculate the colors and the shapes according to the Mandelbrot set functionality and shaders programing.
